# Updated-Portfolio
This is my Updated portfolio made using Materialize. 
The homepage just includes some information about me.

While the portfolio page uses cards to display the projects i have completed. The gem td link is a link to the play store in the future I may deploy the project to a webpage using webGL but I still have to refactor some of the code to make it work properly.
