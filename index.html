                 I live Denver, CO. I am currently learning full-stack development. I have been a Game Developer for over 5 years and have deployed over 4 projects in that time.
                 I have extensive work experience with Unity3D, mostly in scripting using C#. I also have learned C++ and Javascript. 
                 I enjoy photography and know how to use Lightroom and Photoshop.
